# CYK Algorithm in Python

This project offers a Python implementation of the **Cocke‑Younger‑Kasami (CYK) algorithm**, a classic bottom‑up parsing method for context‑free grammars in **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**.

---

## Overview

The CYK algorithm determines whether a given string can be generated by a CFG (in CNF) using dynamic programming. It constructs a triangular parsing table where each cell represents the possible non‑terminal symbols that produce a substring of the input. If the start symbol appears in the top cell, the string is accepted. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Repository Contents

- `CYK-Algorithm.py` – Primary implementation of the algorithm.
- `group_project.py` – Additional script, possibly for grouped input or demo use.
- `README.md` – (This file)

## Usage Instructions

Place your grammar (in CNF) and the target string in the designated input files or variables (depending on script setup), then run:

```bash
python CYK-Algorithm.py
```
The output will indicate whether the string is accepted by the grammar, typically with a display of the filled parsing table.

## Input Format
Grammar: Defined in CNF. Use rules like:
```
A -> BC
A -> a
```
Input String: A sequence of terminals to be parsed.
Be sure to include each production rule clearly, and confirm the grammar follows CNF (i.e., productions are either two non-terminals or one terminal).

## Output
The script should:
- 'True -> Your sentence is valid' if the string is in the language
- 'False -> Your sentence is NOT valid' if the string in not in the language

## Requirements
Python 3.x (tested on ≥3.6)
